## A few logical expressions

Hi there! This is my work

```{r}
# Is 5 equal to 1?
5  == 1
```

```{r}
# Does cat match dog?
"cat" == "dog"
```

Some vectorized questions...

```{r}
meds <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Is meds equal to 3?
meds == 3

# Is meds equal to 1 or greater than 3
meds == 1 | meds > 3
```

More questions...

```{r}
# nceas' dogs age
teddy <- 5
banjo <- 7
tallie <- 4

# Is Teddy less than or equal to Banjo (in age)?
teddy <= banjo
```
